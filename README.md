# trans
Website for trans resources maintained by [Maeve Stites](https://github.com/mstites). Will be launched at [trans.mstites.com](https://trans.mstites.com)

Currently a work in progress in response to repeat transphobia on the BOW campuses (Babson, Olin, Wellseley). This site is meant to start as a starter place to house resources to help with trans activism, support, and education on the campuses.

This will include a trans resource list which started on Maeve's [project they](https://github.com/mstites/project-they) - now defunct, later moving to Maeve's [create](create.mstites.com/) (they.mstites.com - now defunct), and will now reside on this project website.

## Future plans

The first plan for this website will be to host a planned poster campaign in addition to basic site information (about, contact). The details are still in the works, but the posters will be designed with the same purpose of the site: trans activism, support, and education. They will be distributed across the Babson, Olin, Wellesley college campuses hopefully around the time students return to classes.

Other plans:

* History page - store transphobic incidents on the campuses as well as student action for institutional memory
* Trans profile pages to feature trans students
* Progress - feature action made by actions featured on the website.
* Create/charter more permanent trans BOW club - or get involved in student government. Move this website and information over to those places.

## Action Items
* General rebranding of site
Need:
1. Updated color scheme - trans colors?
2. Logo

Updating content:
1. Link name changes
2. About page to be less personal and describe mission and how to be involved
3. Home page should have basic information about trans people and links to some sort of survey for **asking questions** *this needs to be created*

Create content:
Start creating posters!
Keep it simple
